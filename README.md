# 🏛️ LINEBot_For_Subsidy_Search 🏛️

- The interface is in Mandarin.目前只支援繁體中文

LINEBot_For_Subsidy_Search involves using Python for web scraping to gather government subsidy information and inputting the data into a database. Users can access this information through a LineBot. The inspiration behind this project was to help people who lost their jobs due to Covid-19, as many were unfamiliar with how to check for available subsidies.
